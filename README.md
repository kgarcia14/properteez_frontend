### Motivation
I aimed to push my boundaries by creating a full-stack project tailored to my personal use. Given my interest in real estate investing, I chose to develop an application to manage various investment properties and their respective renters.


### Challenges and Solutions
During this project, I faced numerous challenges, with one of the most significant being the integration of authentication. Initially, I used regular cookies on the frontend, unaware that this approach posed a considerable security risk due to its accessibility. To address this issue, I revised my logic to authenticate serverside. Additionally, I ensured that the cookies were set as HTTP cookies, making them inaccessible to JavaScript and thereby enhancing the application's security.
